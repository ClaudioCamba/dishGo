## Frontend

Built in React Native. Runs on Expo Go and Android Emulator.

## Database and API

Supabase hosts the database, storage and provides user authentication. Google Places API retrieves location details, directions and provides the map view

## Minimum Requirements to run DishGo

1. Supabase database and key

Note: the backend is not currently accessible to the public and requires setting up your own Supabase database and key (a guide to do this is TBC).

2.  Google Places API key

If you do not have one already, set one up by following these [docs](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/places/web-service/get-api-key).

3.  Android device with Expo installed 

Download Expo via the [Google Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=host.exp.exponent&hl=en&gl=US). If you do not have an Android device, you may be able to run the app on Android Emulator. Before downloading Android Emulator, please ensure your computer meets these [minimum requirements](https://developer.android.com/studio/run/emulator).

4. Node.js - version ^20.9.0
